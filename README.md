## Objective

The objective of this project is to implement a reverberation phenomenon in MATLAB programming environment using a feedback delay network (FDN) based on Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. The goal is to simulate sound reflections encountered in enclosed spaces and analyze how the IIR filters create reverberation.

# Abstract

In this project we are going to implement a reverberation phenomenon in MATLAB programming environment. Reverberation, a fundamental audio effect, simulates the sound reflections encountered in enclosed spaces. Our approach focuses on designing a feedback delay network (FDN) based on Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters to create the reverberation phenomenon and analyze it to find how the filter creates reverberation. This work contributes to the field of audio signal processing and provides insights into the design and implementation of IIR-based echoing effects. Future research may explore advanced techniques for enhancing the realism and spatialization of echoes using additional signal processing algorithms.

Here we have mainly focusing on the Case 3: i,e. Student No - 3; Td=0.22sec, G=0.45

## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `src/`: This directory contains the MATLAB source code for the digital filters implementation.
- `data/`: Here, you can find the "countdownfrom.mp3" speech file used as input data.
- `results/`: Contains the output audio files generated by the filters and the comparison results.
- `docs/`: Any additional documentation related to the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/SreeduttRamJ/Reverbaration_using_Filters

```
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory and run the MATLAB script to generate the simulated audio echoes.

3. The output audio files are saved in the `results/` directory for further analysis and comparison.

You can Copy the code from here:

## Source Code

```
clc
clearvars
close all

[x,fs]=audioread("countdown.mp3"); %make sure the file is in the same folder as your code

G = 0.45;
Td = 0.22;


% Calculate Nd based on Td and Fs
Nd = round(Td * fs);

% Defining the filter coefficients
b = [1];
a = [1 -G];

% Compute the frequency and phase response
freqz(b, a);


% Plot the pole-zero diagram
figure
pzmap(tf(b,a))

% Check filter stability
poles = roots(a);
if all(abs(poles) < 0)
    disp('Filter is stable.');
else
    disp('Filter is unstable.');
end
